# Sweep-set graph algorithms

**This package has been deprecated in favour of the [SGTL library](https://github.com/pmacg/py-sgtl).**

This repository gives some straightforward implementations of two closely related
fundamental algorithms in spectral graph theory:
- the cheeger sweep set algorithm for finding low-conductance sets and
- the cheeger-trevisan sweep set algorithm for finding low-bipartiteness sets.

The goal is to provide clear, readable code to help with understanding the algorithms
as well as to give a reference implementation of these algorithms on networkx graphs
since these are a common building block for building more complex spectral graph
algorithms.
